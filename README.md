# BBFRVR

And end of year project I made during my last months in high school. 
I found an interesting minigame on Facebook which had users shoot a basketball into a hoop by drag-swiping on a mobile-esk screen.
I decided to see if I could make a purely client sided bot to play the game automatically; 
later in the game I had to deal with moving hoops, which made it very interesting problem to try and solve.
